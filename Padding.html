        <h1>Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in <br> 
            India commemorating the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, <br>
             the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence Act,<br>
              which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. India retained <br>
              King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the <br>
              Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix,<br> 
              Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. <br>
              India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.</h1>
